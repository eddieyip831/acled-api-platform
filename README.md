# ACLED API Platform â€” architecture diagrams as code

This repository renders the ACLED Trendfinder style API architecture using the `diagrams` Python library and Graphviz.  
The diagram shows an application service on DigitalOcean calling an AWS HTTP API on API Gateway that triggers a Lambda which reads from a DigitalOcean Managed MySQL database over TLS. Optional CloudFront, ACM and CloudWatch are included.
